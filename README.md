# Challenge Overview 

In this challenge I analyzed data from fifteen different high schools. Using pandas I determined/calculated and displayed the following: 

    School type

    Number of students per school

    Total budget per school 

    Per capita spending per school

    Average math score per school

    Average reading score per school 

    Passing math rate per school

    Passing reading rate per school 

    Overall passing rate per school

    Math, reading, and overall passing rates by grade per school 

Using this information I analyzed the relationship between school type, student body size, and budget and what affect these factors had on the overall success of a school in terms of math and reading pass rates.
